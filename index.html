    <p><b>Deep Patel</b> - <i>Creator and Enthusiast</i>. <br>I have graduated Rutgers in 2017 with a degree in Applied Mathematics. 
      Currently, I am a student in the Rutgers Bootcamp for Data Visualization. My interest in this stemmed from my curiousity on all the different types of 
      insights that data can give when performing methods of analysis. I also enjoy day trading while running a small business on Amazon 
      and try to post content for my blog from time to time. A few of my hobbies include surfing, riding my motorcycle and reading books on 
      real estate investing and business practices. I believe everyday is an oppurtunity to grow and learn something new. Feel free to reach out to me if you would
      like to connect!
